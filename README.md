# Sentiment-Network
Built a Neural Network from scratch for performing the sentiment analysis of the reviews. 

## Features:
- 3 layer neural network
- 10 Nodes in the hidden layer
- Achieved an accuracy of 87% on the test set
- Achieved an speed of 4400 reviews/sec on my system
- Analysis is performed for reducing the noise by finding the polarity of each word
- Plots have been used to show the polarity of words
- Network was able to identify words with similar sentiments (shown using tf-idf)


This project is performed in a progressive manner. First a simple approach is tried and then changes are made to improve the performance.

## Running the project:
Activate a python3 conda environment. In this environment, you'll need to have installed:
- numpy
- jupyter notebook 
- matplotlib 
- scikit-learn and 
- bokeh

Change directories into the downloaded folder.

Start up your Jupyter notebook server.

Open SentimentNetwork.ipynb.
